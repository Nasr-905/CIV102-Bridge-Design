In **CIV102**, we were tasked with building a bridge using *matboard* and *glue* to withstand the load of a model train. Adhering to engineering constraints, such as limited matboard and glue resources, and physical constraints governing *length*, *width*, and *height*, we generated and proxy-tested potential options. Leveraging **MATLAB** (later ported to *NumPy* and *Matplotlib*), I conducted in-depth analyses to calculate forces, moments, and failure points on several bridge designs. This iterative computational approach allowed for precise predictions and optimization before constructing the physical prototype. Through strategic design and simulation, I successfully navigated the delicate balance between material constraints and structural integrity, showcasing proficiency in both theoretical analysis and practical implementation.
